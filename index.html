                <p class="description">Hey, thanks for looking into me. My names
                    Nathan Ramirez. I moved around a lot, and have probably stayed
                    in around 12 houses now. I'm used to change, and am plenty
                    able to adapt. I grew up loving nature, and I hold true to
                    that this day. To me, a beautiful sunset is one of the
                    greatest things that someone can see. I had long hair all my
                    life until I cut it through High School. I still have longer 
                    hair than normal, but much shorter than I constantly kept it
                    when I was younger. I work out six times a week, and plan to 
                    continue until my bones break trying to lift another weight.
                    Later in life, I want to travel to other countries and see
                    what they all have to offer. I have four siblings, with me
                    being the youngest, but of course, the greatest. Saved the
                    best for last and all that jazz. When I was younger I was much
                    more introverted, but now it doesn't really matter. I don't 
                    mind any music, as long as it is good. Good music is good
                    music, no matter if it's rock, rap, country, or jazz. My
                    favorite artistt is The Weeknd, but especially his older music.
                    I grew up in California and plan to stay inside for as long as
                    I'm able. I enjoy reading, writing, and hanging out with 
                    friends. I'm a quick learner and strive to have 'perfection' 
                    everywhere. I enjoy cars, science and ecology. I like to help 
                    people feel better about their day, and hope that people always
                     leave with a good impression of me after any interaction. I 
                     wish to make it in this field, and will try again and again to
                      make it happen. Look forward to seeing you!
